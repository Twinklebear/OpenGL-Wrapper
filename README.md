OpenGL-Wrapper
==============

A simple OpenGL Wrapper/Learning project I'm working on

This only really exists as a git repo because my OpenCL-OpenGL Interop project depends on this one to simplify the OpenGL code and I don't want to have my wrapper code get split between these projects and diverge. This project also serves as an OpenGL learning playground for me, or I guess anyone else who wants to mess with it.
